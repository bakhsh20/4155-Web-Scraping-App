TThis is a webscraping application that navigates throughout UNCC department pages and extracts information about faculty members and their fields of interest. The software then creates a CSV output that incldes the faculty member and keywords associated with them. 

This application was created as a tool to serve Faculty Connections. Faculty Connections is website that contains an aggregation of information about UNCC faculty staff and their fields of interest. Faculty members at UNCC are listed on their websites, with keywords that are related to them based of their research and fields of interest. Faculty connections currently finds information on faculty members manually and wanted an automated way to find this information.
